## General Information and Assumptions
App trader is a broker that purchases the rights to apps from developers in order to market the apps and offer in-app purchase. App developers retain **all** money from users purchasing the app, and they retain _half_ of the money made from in-app purchases. App Trader will be solely responsible for marketing apps they purchase rights to.  

Based on research completed prior to launching App Trader as a company, we assume the following:  

a. App Trader will purchase apps for 10,000 times the price of the app. For apps that are priced from free up to $1.00, the purchase price is $10,000.  

b. Apps earn $5000 per month on average from in-app advertising and in-app purchases _regardless_ of the price of the app.  

c. App Trader will spend an average of $1000 per month to market an app _regardless_ of the price of the app. If App Trader owns rights to the app in both stores, it can market the app for both stores for a single cost of $1000 per month.  

d. For every half point that an app gains in rating, its projected lifespan increases by one year, in other words, an app with a rating of 0 can be expected to be in use for 1 year, an app with a rating of 1.0 can be expected to last 3 years, and an app with a rating of 4.0 can be expected to last 9 years. Ratings should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 to evaluate an app's likely longevity.  

e. App Trader would prefer to work with apps that are available in both the App Store and the Play Store since they can market both for the same $1000 per month.

Final product/presentation includes recommendations about price range, genre, content rating, etc. for App Trader to target. Additionally, a list of 10 apps that the company should purchase for a special **Black Friday** debut.
